# 📚 Book Recommender System

A Book Recommender System built using Python and pandas to provide book recommendations based on user ratings and preferences.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from a book dataset containing information about books, users, and their ratings. It aims to recommend books to users using collaborative filtering techniques and popularity-based filtering.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of three CSV files:

- `Books.csv`: Contains details about books such as title, author, and ISBN.
- `Users.csv`: Contains demographic information of users.
- `Ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for books (explicit ratings).

These datasets were loaded from the following directory:


> Note: You may need to adjust the file paths if you're running this on a different system.
